These are attempted by my `site_traffic` function within my router's reach and no VPN or similar items were used in this process. The program here is Fiddler as per python requirements

# Fethcing Traffic.

While using the python file with fiddler, Approximate amount of traffic is captured. I have used www.google.com as an example. So, while getting the process following details are captured.


✔️ Also, navigating to one of the websites after getting the data about traffic, that whole data code is stored on this website(only for this case)

This link is used as an example of a particular case which was released while getting the traffic details.

✔️ These are the report for the single packet received after the traffic check.
